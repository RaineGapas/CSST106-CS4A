# Machine Problem 5

The ativity givenn detects objects in images using YOLOv3. It downloads the YOLO model files, loads an image, detects objects, draws labeled boxes around them, and displays the results. It also includes a function to test multiple images at once.

In these photos, the YOLOv3 model has identified several objects, each highlighted with a green box and labeled with its name and a confidence score (showing how certain the model is about each guess). In the first image, you can see items like a spoon, a cup, and a remote labeled on a table setting. The second image shows a variety of fruits, such as bananas, a pineapple, and a watermelon, with each fruit clearly marked. In the third image, thereâ€™s an apple and a cup, both labeled with confidence scores. The labeled boxes provide a neat overview of the items in each scene, making it easy to spot each object in the images.
